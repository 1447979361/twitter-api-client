        description: |
          Allows a Consumer application to use an OAuth request_token to request user authorization. 
          This method is a replacement of Section 6.2 of the OAuth 1.0 authentication flow for applications 
          using the callback authentication flow. The method will use the currently logged in user as the account 
          for access authorization unless the force_login parameter is set to true.This method differs from 
          GET oauth / authorize in that if the user has already granted the application permission, 
          the redirect will occur without the user having to re-approve the application. 
          To realize this behavior, you must enable the Use Sign in with Twitter setting on your application record.
        parameters:
          - name: force_login
            description: Forces the user to enter their credentials to ensure the correct users account is authorized.

        description: |
          Allows a Consumer application to use an OAuth Request Token to request user authorization. 
          This method fulfills Section 6.2 of the OAuth 1.0 authentication flow. 
          Desktop applications must use this method (and cannot use GET oauth / authenticate).
          Usage Note: An oauth_callback is never sent to this method, provide it to POST oauth / request_token instead.
        parameters:
          - name: force_login
            description: Forces the user to enter their credentials to ensure the correct users account is authorized.
            required: false

        resourceUrl: https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token
        description: |
          Allows a Consumer application to exchange the OAuth Request Token for an
          OAuth Access Token. This method fulfills Section 6.3 of the OAuth 1.0 authentication flow.
      - title: POST oauth/invalidate_token
        url: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/api-reference/invalidate_access_token
        resourceUrl: https://api.twitter.com/1.1/oauth/invalidate_token
        description: |
          Allows a registered application to revoke an issued OAuth access_token 
          by presenting its client credentials. Once an access_token has been invalidated, 
          new creation attempts will yield a different Access Token and usage of 
          the invalidated token will no longer be allowed.
        exampleResponse: |
          { "access_token":"ACCESS_TOKEN" }
      - title: POST oauth/request_token
        url: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/api-reference/request_token
        resourceUrl: https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token
        exampleResponse: |
          { "access_token": "ACCESS_TOKEN" }
      - title: POST oauth2/invalidate_token
        url: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/api-reference/invalidate_bearer_token
        resourceUrl: https://api.twitter.com/oauth2/invalidate_token
        description: |
          Allows a registered application to revoke an issued oAuth 2.0 Bearer Token by presenting 
          its client credentials. Once a Bearer Token has been invalidated, new creation 
          attempts will yield a different Bearer Token and usage of the invalidated 
          token will no longer be allowed.Successful responses include a 
          JSON-structure describing the revoked Bearer Token.
        exampleResponse: |
          { "access_token": "ACCESS_TOKEN" }
      - title: POST oauth2/token
        url: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/api-reference/token
        resourceUrl: https://api.twitter.com/oauth2/token
        description: |
          Allows a registered application to obtain an OAuth 2 Bearer Token, 
          which can be used to make API requests on an application's own behalf, 
          without a user context. This is called Application-only authentication.
          A Bearer Token may be invalidated using oauth2/invalidate_token. 
          Once a Bearer Token has been invalidated, new creation attempts will yield a different Bearer Token and 
          usage of the previous token will no longer be allowed.
          Only one bearer token may exist outstanding for an application, and repeated requests to this method 
          will yield the same already-existent token until it has been invalidated.
          Successful responses include a JSON-structure describing the awarded Bearer Token.
          Tokens received by this method should be cached. 
          If attempted too frequently, requests will be rejected with a HTTP 403 with code 99.
        parameters:
          - name: grant_type
            description: |
              Specifies the type of grant being requested by the application.
              At this time, only client_credentials is allowed. See Application-Only Authentication
              for more information.
